This C++ program analyzes red light camera violation data by reading comma-separated values from a user-specified file and providing an interactive menu-driven interface for generating various informational insights and summaries. The program defines a CameraRecord class that encapsulates six private data members (intersection, address, camera number, date, violations, and neighborhood) with a constructor for initialization and six public getter methods for accessing the stored information while maintaining encapsulation principles. The file reading function opens the specified file using an ifstream object, reads it line-by-line using getline, and parses each line with a stringstream that extracts comma-delimited fields into their respective variables, converting the camera number and violations strings to integers using the stoi function wrapped in a try-catch block to handle parsing errors gracefully, then creates CameraRecord objects using emplace_back for efficient in-place construction and returns a vector containing all successfully parsed records. The main function prompts the user for a filename, calls the file reading function, validates that records were successfully loaded, and enters a do-while loop that repeatedly displays a menu with five options, reads the user's choice, uses cin.ignore to clear the input buffer after reading the integer, and employs a switch statement to route execution to the appropriate analysis function until the user selects option five to exit. The data overview function provides comprehensive statistics by iterating through all records to calculate total violations, maintaining a vector of unique camera numbers by checking if each camera number already exists using the find algorithm before adding it, tracking the maximum violations in a single day along with the corresponding intersection and date, then parsing the date string (originally in YYYY-MM-DD format) using a stringstream with getline and dash delimiters to extract year, month, and day components, reformatting it to MM-DD-YYYY, and displaying the total record count, unique camera count, total violations, and the maximum violation details. The results by neighborhood function creates a custom NeighborhoodData struct containing the neighborhood name, camera count, total violations, and a vector to track unique camera IDs, then iterates through all records to either update existing neighborhood data or create new entries, using nested loops to search for matching neighborhoods and the find algorithm to check if a camera ID has already been counted for that neighborhood to ensure accurate unique camera counts, after which it sorts the neighborhoods vector in descending order by violations using a lambda comparator function, and finally displays the results in formatted columns using setw for alignment with neighborhood names left-justified in a 25-character field and numeric values right-justified. The chart by month function creates a 12-element integer array initialized to zero to store violations for each month, extracts the month number from each record's date string using substr to get characters at positions 5-6 (the month portion in YYYY-MM-DD format), subtracts one to convert from 1-12 to 0-11 array indexing, accumulates violations for each month, then displays a text-based bar chart by printing each month name from a predefined string array followed by asterisks where each asterisk represents 1000 violations calculated by dividing the monthly total by 1000 and using the string constructor to create a string of that many asterisk characters. The search cameras function prompts the user for a search query using getline to capture the full input including spaces, converts the query to lowercase using the transform algorithm with the tolower function to enable case-insensitive searching, maintains an unordered_set to track camera numbers that have already been displayed to prevent duplicates when a single camera appears in multiple records, iterates through all records converting each intersection and neighborhood to lowercase and checking if either contains the search query as a substring using the find method which returns string::npos when no match is found, and displays complete camera information (number, address, intersection, and neighborhood) only for unique cameras that match the search criteria or prints "No cameras found" if no matches exist. Throughout the implementation, the program demonstrates advanced C++ concepts including object-oriented design with proper encapsulation through private data members and public accessors, efficient STL container usage with vectors for dynamic storage and unordered_sets for O(1) lookup performance, robust error handling with try-catch blocks for parsing failures and file operation validation, modern C++ features like range-based for loops and lambda expressions for cleaner code, string manipulation techniques using stringstream for parsing and transform for case conversion, formatted output with iomanip manipulators like setw and left/right for professional-looking displays, algorithm library functions like find and sort for common operations, and a modular design with separate functions for each menu option that accept the records vector by constant reference to avoid unnecessary copying while ensuring data integrity, ultimately creating a comprehensive data analysis tool that allows users to explore red light camera violation patterns through statistical summaries, geographic breakdowns, temporal visualizations, and targeted searches.
